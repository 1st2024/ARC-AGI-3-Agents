# ARC-AGI-3 Agents

ARC-AGI-3-Agents is a framework for building AI agents that play ARC-AGI-3 games. These games are novel, fun, ARC-like puzzles that require only Core Knowledge to win and follow a dynamic format (unlike static input/output pairs from ARC-AGI-1 and ARC-AGI-2). More information can be found on the main website: https://arcprize.org/
